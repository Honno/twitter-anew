# Twitter Anew

If you follow so many people on twitter that your feed becomes an endless 24/7 deluge of depressing hot takes about why everything sucks, then *Twitter Anew* may just be for you.

Useful tools to have a fresh start included are:
* Creating a Twitter list that stores everyone you're following
* Generating a backup file that stores all users you currently follow
* Unfollowing everyone!
* And god forbid you want to follow them all again, you can just following them all again using that backup file
